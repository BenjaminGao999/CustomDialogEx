1、BottomSheetDialog
    ① material design 提供了bottomSheetDialog
    在app的build.gradle添加依赖：
     compile 'com.android.support:design:25.3.0'
     使用很简单：
    //BottomSheetDialog兼容到api level 15
        private void showBottomSheetDialog() {
            BottomSheetDialog bottomSheetDialog = new BottomSheetDialog(this);
            bottomSheetDialog.setContentView(R.layout.layout_bottomsheetdialog);
            bottomSheetDialog.show();
        }

     ② 自定义dialog实现bottomSheetDialog
       自定义Dialog要求具备的知识点：

       WindowManger
       Window

       ③  Window和WindowManager的作用，以及Window和WindowManager的关系：

              来看看精辟的回答：
                啥是WindowManager?
                 The Android WindowManager is a system service, which is responsible for managing the z-ordered list of windows,
                    which windows are visible, and how they are laid out on screen. Among other things,
                       it automatically performs window transitions and animations when opening or closing an app or rotating the screen.
                 啥是Window?
                 Every activity has a Window that is used to display its content on the screen. When you call setContentView on an activity,
                 it attaches that view to the activity's default window. The default window fills the screen,
                 so that your activity's window hides any other activities -- the WindowManager will display whichever window is on top.
                 So normally you don't need to worry about windows - you just create an activity and Android will do the rest for you.

                WindowManager和Window啥关系？
                   Every Activity has a Window,WindowManager managers windows.
